## Stock Price Data Excel Project
**Project Overview**
This project analyzes the historical stock price data of five leading technology companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Netflix — to evaluate their performance and market trends over time. The primary goal is to derive actionable financial insights using Excel-based data analysis and visualization techniques. Through data cleaning, formulas, pivot tables, and interactive charts, the project measures key indicators such as daily returns, moving averages, and volatility to assess stock behavior and comparative performance. The findings are consolidated into an interactive Excel dashboard, allowing users to track trends, compare companies, and make informed investment decisions based on historical patterns and market dynamics.

•	Date Information: The trading date for each record.
•	Price Details: Open, High, Low, Close, and Adjusted Close prices for each company on each trading day.
•	Trading Volume: Total number of shares traded during the day for each stock.
•	Stock Identifier: Ticker symbol or company name to distinguish between the different companies.
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of stock performance for these tech giants, enabling detailed analysis of price trends, returns, volatility, and comparative performance over time using Excel.
